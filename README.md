My personal code


makeitANDhackit README provided by GITHUB




Made in Australia by ProCactus
A fairly exotic way of detecting BPM of anything within a few hundred Beats Per Minute(1 or 2 modifications to set a MAX limit).
I am sure it can do much more than just provide a single BPM.
It should ba able to be modified to detect in real time various BPMs that can occur in some songs simultainously. (I have NOT implemented this yet)
Its not perfect but I think very interesting and very accurate for the most part.

Sometimes it goes absolutly fucking NUTS, And then comes good.
Sometimes it triggers on beat, Sometimes Off-Beat.

Totally realtime, Totally my own code. Nothing is copyed. Not even the concept of how to approch the problem/application.


THE LEAST ANNOYING REALTIME STROBE ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN. BY DESIGN.

Did I mention it will lock it self to a beat for semi-rock solid performance ;)
